# English-Fluency-Journey

### What's this?
This project contains several modules that I have created to achieve English fluency.

### Why does it exist? 
I want to apply the scientific research method to my journey of becoming fluent in English.

Based on my current English level(approximately B2), I have designed several modules to help me reach my goal.

# Module 1 - Longman 3000 words 

**Goal** - Be able to use the Longman 3000 words(in both writing and speaking) within a year. 

**Method** - Use ChatGPT as a teaching tool.

### Steps:
1. **Copy and paste** today's list from the "database"(Goole Sheet).
2. **Prompt ChatGPT:** Teach me today's mixed-order 10 words, including the grammatical category, "using the list from the database.
3. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Tell me a story using today's 10 words."
4. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Quiz me on the words I've learned. I'd like to practice making sentences with these words. I also like to practice these grammar points when writing sentences". **Send grammar points** that I need to practice to ChatGPT.
5. **Write sentences**, get feedback from ChatGPT, and paste the corrected sentences into the **database**.
6. **Record the sentences** spoken by ChatGPT(plan the audio on Mac, record with iPhone), then read and repeat each sentence out loud at least 10 times.
7. **Record yourself** reading these sentences, and upload the audio file to Google Drive.
8. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "When should I review these words next?" Record the review date in the database.
9. **Record the time** spent on the entire process in the database.
10. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "What kind of sentence structures and tenses I've never used before?" Paste the answer into the **database** for tomorrow's session.
11. **Review**: Read and repeat the sentences aloud at least 5 times per sentence to review.


# Module 2 - Unfamiliar Words and Phrases

### What's this?
Unlike the Longman 3000 words, in which I at least know one Chinese meaning already, there are many words, phrases, and idioms I know nothing at all. I keep a record of all the unfamiliar words or phrases I have encountered in a Google Sheet. Of course, 3000 words are far from enough, So I need to get more familiar with this list to become more fluent.

**Goal** - The first stage goal is just to know the basic meaning of these words and phrases and to be familiar with their pronunciation.

**Method** - Use ChatGPT as a teaching tool

4. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Tell me a story using today's words."
5. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Quiz me on the words I've learned."
6. **Record the time** "Spent on the entire process in the database."

# Module 3 - Family Album USA

### What's this?
Family Album USA is a popular TV show among Chinese English learners because it's espically made for English learners and recommended by many teachers. 

**Goal** - I've spent about 2 months to memorize the first 13 episodes of this show, which primarily benefit to my pronunciation and intonation. I want to continue learning this material, but by spending as little time as possible.

**Method** -
