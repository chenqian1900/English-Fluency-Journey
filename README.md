# English-Fluency-Journey

### What's this?
This project contains several modules that I have created to achieve English fluency.

### Why does it exist? 
I want to apply the scientific research method to my journey of becoming fluent in English.

Based on my current English level(approximately B2), I have designed several modules to help me reach my goal.

# Module 1 - Longman 3000 words 

**Goal** - Be able to use the Longman 3000 words(in both writing and speaking) within a year. 

**Method** - Use ChatGPT as a teaching tool.

### Steps:
1. **Copy and paste** today's list from the "database"(Goole Sheet).
2. **Prompt ChatGPT:** Teach me today's mixed-order 10 words, including the grammatical category, "using the list from the database.
3. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Tell me a story using today's 10 words."
4. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Quiz me on the words I've learned. I'd like to practice making sentences with these words. I also like to practice these grammar points when writing sentences". **Send grammar points** that I need to practice to ChatGPT.
5. **Write sentences**, get feedback from ChatGPT, and paste the corrected sentences into the **database**.
6. **Record the sentences** spoken by ChatGPT(play the audio on Mac, record with iPhone), then read and repeat each sentence out loud at least 10 times.
7. **Record yourself** reading these sentences, and upload the audio file to Google Drive.
8. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "When should I review these words next?" Record the review date in the database.
9. **Record the time** spent on the entire process in the database.
10. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "What kind of sentence structures and tenses I've never used before?" Paste the answer into the **database** for tomorrow's session.
11. **Review**: Read and repeat the sentences aloud at least 5 times per sentence to review.


# Module 2 - Unfamiliar Words and Phrases

### What's this?
Unlike the Longman 3000 words, in which I at least know one Chinese meaning already, there are many words, phrases, and idioms I know nothing at all. I keep a record of all the unfamiliar words or phrases I have encountered in a Google Sheet. Of course, 3000 words are far from enough, so I need to get more familiar with this list to become more fluent.

**Goal** - The first stage goal is just to know the basic meaning of these words and phrases and to be familiar with their pronunciation.

**Method** - Use ChatGPT as a teaching tool

### Steps:
1. **Copy and paste** today's list from the "database"(Goole Sheet).
2. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Explain these words or phrases as if I'm a 6-year-old child."
3. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Teach me today's mixed-order words, including the grammatical category, "using the list from the database."
4. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Tell me a story using today's words."
5. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Quiz me on the words I've learned."
6. **Record the time** spent on the entire process in the database.

# Module 3 - Family Album USA

### What's this?
Family Album USA is a popular TV show among Chinese English learners because it's espically made for learning English and recommended by many teachers. 

**Goal** - I've spent about 2 months to memorize the first 13 episodes of this show, which primarily benefit to my pronunciation and intonation. I want to continue learning this material, but by spending as little time as possible.

**Method** - Use ChatGPT as a teaching tool

---

### Steps:
1. **Listen and Repeat** one episode(3 acts) that I've memorized previously(episode 1 to 13).
2. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Quiz me about the senarios of episode **X**. I'd like to practice making 10 sentences with these words. I also like to practice these grammar points when writing sentences". **Send grammar points** that I need to practice to ChatGPT.
3. **Listen and Repeat** one act of the episodes that I've never studied before(episodes 14 to 26).
4. **Write down** one act of the script that I need to study the next day(episodes 14 to 26).
5. **Record the time** spent during the entire process.
   
# Module 4 - Drill 1000 Sentences

### What's this?
Achieving fluency by memorizing 1000 thousand sentences around my life. This method is recommended by the YouTuber Vaughn Gene and shared the core idea from Li Kaifu's method. (https://1000h.org/) 

**Goal** - By memorizing 1000 sentences around my life, I will be able to acheive fluency(Of course wouldn't be perfect).

**Method** - Memorizing 30 sentences per day.
Prepare sentences: 1. 10 sentences are from modules 1 I write the day before.
                   2.
