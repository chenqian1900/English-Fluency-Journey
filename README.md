# English-Fluency-Journey

### What's this?
This project contains several modules that I have created to achieve English fluency.

### Why does it exist? 
I want to apply the scientific research method to my journey of becoming fluent in English.

Based on my current English level(approximately B2), I have designed several modules to help me reach my goal.

# Module 1 - Longman 3000 words 

**Goal** - Be able to use the Longman 3000 words(in both writing and speaking) within a year. 

**Method** - Use ChatGPT as a teaching tool.

3. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Tell me a story using today's 10 words."
4. **Prompt ChatGPT:** "Quiz me on the words I've learned. I'd like to practice making sentences with these words."
5. **Write sentences**, get feedback from ChatGPT, and paste the corrected sentences into the **database**.
6. **Record the sentences** spoken by ChatGPT(plan the audio on Mac, record with iPhone), then read and repeat each sentence out loud at least 10 times.
7. **Record yourself** reading these sentences, and upload the audio file to Google Drive.
8. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "When should I review these words next?" Record the review date in the database.
9. **Record the time** spent on the entire process in the database.
10. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "What kind of sentence structures and tenses I've never used before?" Paste the answer into the **database** for tomorrow's session.
11. **Reveiw**: Read and repeat the sentences aloud at least 5 times per sentence to review.
