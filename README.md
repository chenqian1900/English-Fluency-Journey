# English-Fluency-Journey

### What is this?
This project contains several modules that I have created to achieve English fluency.

### Purpose
I want to apply the scientific research method to my journey of becoming fluent in English.

Based on my current English level (approximately B2), I have designed several modules to help me reach my goal.

# Module 1 - Longman 3000 Words 

**Goal** - Be able to use the Longman 3000 words (in both writing and speaking) within a year. 

**Method** - Use ChatGPT as a teaching tool.

---

### Steps:

1. **Copy and paste** today’s list from the **database** (Google Sheet).
2. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "Teach me today’s mixed-order 10 words, including the grammatical category," using the list from the database.
3. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "Tell me a story using today’s 10 words."
4. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "Quiz me on the words I’ve learned. I’d like to practice making sentences with these words. I also want to practice these grammar points when writing sentences." **Send grammar points** that I need to practice to ChatGPT.
5. **Write sentences**, get feedback from ChatGPT, and paste the corrected sentences into the **database**.
6. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "When should I review these words next?" Record the review date in the database.
7. **Record the time** spent on the entire process in the database.
8. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "What kinds of sentence structures and tenses have I never used before?" Paste the answer into the **database** for tomorrow’s session.
9. **Review**: Read and repeat the sentences aloud at least 5 times per sentence to review.

# Module 2 - Unfamiliar Words and Phrases

**What is this?** - Unlike the Longman 3000 words, where I already know at least one Chinese meaning, there are many words, phrases, and idioms I know nothing about. I keep a record of all the unfamiliar words or phrases I encounter in a Google Sheet. Since 3000 words are far from enough, I need to familiarize myself with this list to become fluent.

**Goal** - The initial goal is to understand the basic meaning of these words and phrases and to become familiar with their pronunciation.

**Method** - Use ChatGPT as a teaching tool.

### Steps:

2. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "Explain these words or phrases as if I were a 6-year-old child."
3. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "Teach me today’s mixed-order words or phrases, including their grammatical categories, using the list from the database."
4. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "Tell me a story using today’s words and phrases."
5. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "Quiz me on all these words and phrases I’ve learned with multiple-choice questions."
6. **Record the time** spent on the entire process in the database.

# Module 3 - Family Album USA

**What is this?** - *Family Album USA* is a popular TV show among Chinese English learners because it was especially made for learning English and is recommended by many teachers.

**Goal** - I’ve spent about 2 months memorizing the first 13 episodes of this show, which has primarily improved my pronunciation and intonation. I want to continue learning this material but with minimal time investment.

**Method** - Use ChatGPT as a teaching tool.

---

### Steps:

1. **Listen and repeat** one episode (3 acts) that I’ve memorized previously (episodes 1 to 13).
2. **Prompt ChatGPT**: "Quiz me about the scenarios of episode **X**. I’d like to practice making 10 sentences with these words. I also want to practice these grammar points when writing sentences." **Send grammar points** that I need to practice to ChatGPT.
3. **Listen and repeat** one act from an episode I haven’t studied yet (episodes 14 to 26).
4. **Write down** one act of the script that I need to study the next day (episodes 14 to 26).
5. **Record the time** spent during the entire process in the database.

# Module 4 - Drill 1000 Sentences

**What is this?** - This method involves achieving fluency by memorizing 1000 sentences relevant to my life. This approach is recommended by the YouTuber Vaughn Gene and shares core principles from Li Kaifu’s method. (https://1000h.org/)

**Goal** - By memorizing 1000 sentences related to my daily life, I aim to achieve fluency (though it may not be perfect).

**Method** - Memorize 30 sentences per day.

---

### Steps:

1. **Memorize Sentences**: Draw simple pictures on A4 paper to help memorize the sentences. Constantly listen and repeat after the recordings to memorize them.
2. **Record and Submit Homework**: After memorizing all the sentences with the help of the drawings, record yourself reciting them. Upload the file to Google Drive to submit the homework.
3. **Prepare Sentences for the next session** 
   - 10 sentences are from Module 1, created the day before (these sentences are usually related to myself).
   - 10 sentences are from Module 2, created the day before (these sentences are usually related to myself).
   - 10 sentences are sentences I created the day before related to various scenarios in my life or my thoughts and ideas.
   - Record the sentences spoken by ChatGPT (play the audio on a Mac, record with an iPhone).
   - Write down all the sentences on A4 paper; Record all the audio from ChatGPT; Record all the sentences in the database.
4. **Record the time** needed for each step in the database.
